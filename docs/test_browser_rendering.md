# Manual Browser Testing Guide for Streamlit UI

## Test Checklist

### 1. Initial Page Load (localhost:8501)
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Title "PDF OCR Text Extractor" is visible
- [ ] Database statistics section appears at bottom

### 2. Summarization Controls - Folder Processing Section

#### Location: Below directory path input
Expected UI elements:
```
Select Directory
[Text Input: Enter directory path containing PDF files...]
[x] Enable summarization during processing
    Generate AI-powered summaries of extracted text (requires API key)
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to the directory input section
2. Verify checkbox is visible and labeled "Enable summarization during processing"
3. Verify help text shows on hover: "Generate AI-powered summaries..."
4. Test checkbox interaction (click to enable/disable)
5. Verify checkbox state persists while entering directory path

**Expected Behavior:**
- Checkbox appears BEFORE entering directory path
- Checkbox is UNchecked by default (value=False)
- Checkbox works independently of directory selection

### 3. On-Demand Summarization - Database Records Section

#### Location: Within "Recent Processed Files" expandable cards

**Test Steps for Records WITHOUT Summary:**
1. Scroll to "Database Records" section
2. Expand a record that doesn't have a summary
3. Look for "Generate Summary" button

Expected UI:
```
üìÑ filename.pdf - 2024-01-01 12:00:00
  > [Expanded]
    Word Count: 100     Characters: 500
    [Button: Generate Summary]
    Preview: [text area with preview]
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Button only appears if:
  - Record has NO summary
  - SUMMARIZER_AVAILABLE is True
  - extracted_text exists
- Button has unique key: `gen_summary_{record_id}`
- Clicking button shows spinner with "Generating summary..."
- After success, shows "Summary generated and saved!" and page reloads

**Test Steps for Records WITH Summary:**
1. Expand a record that HAS a summary

Expected UI:
```
üìÑ filename.pdf - 2024-01-01 12:00:00
  > [Expanded]
    Word Count: 100     Characters: 500
    **Summary:**
    [Summary text content displayed here]
    Preview: [text area with preview]
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- No "Generate Summary" button appears
- Summary is displayed with bold "**Summary:**" header
- Summary text is shown using st.write()

### 4. Conditional Logic Tests

**Test Case A: Summarization Disabled**
1. Leave "Enable summarization during processing" UNchecked
2. Enter valid directory with PDFs
3. Click "Process All PDF Files"
4. Expected: No "Generating summary..." messages during processing

**Test Case B: Summarization Enabled**
1. Check "Enable summarization during processing"
2. Enter valid directory with PDFs
3. Click "Process All PDF Files"
4. Expected: Status shows "Generating summary for: filename.pdf" for each file
5. Expected: Success messages include "(with summary)" suffix

**Test Case C: Summarizer Not Available (no API key)**
1. Ensure no OPENAI_API_KEY in environment
2. Check "Enable summarization during processing"
3. Process files
4. Expected: Processing continues but summaries are truncated/fallback versions

### 5. Layout Tests

**Verify Element Ordering:**
1. Page Title
2. Description text
3. "Select Directory" header
4. Directory path input
5. **Summarization checkbox** ‚Üê Should be here
6. Directory validation / PDF list
7. "Process All PDF Files" button
8. "Database Records" header
9. Recent files with expand/collapse

**Verify No Hidden Elements:**
- Check browser inspector (F12) for any elements with:
  - `display: none`
  - `visibility: hidden`
  - Conditional rendering that might hide controls

### 6. State Management Tests

**Test Button Keys:**
- Multiple records with "Generate Summary" buttons should have unique keys
- Format: `gen_summary_{record_id}` where record_id is the database ID
- No key conflicts should occur

**Test Preview Text Areas:**
- Each preview should have unique key: `preview_{record_id}`
- Text areas should display first 200 chars + "..."

### 7. Error Conditions

**Test Missing Import:**
- Check logs for "Summarizer module not available" warning
- If SUMMARIZER_AVAILABLE = False, verify:
  - Checkbox still appears (user can check it)
  - "Generate Summary" buttons don't appear
  - Processing with checkbox enabled shows appropriate message

**Test API Failures:**
- Enable summarization with invalid/missing API key
- Verify graceful error handling
- Check that processing continues despite summary failures

## Browser Testing Commands

### Open Browser Console (F12)
Check for:
- JavaScript errors (red messages)
- Streamlit connection issues
- Warning messages

### Network Tab
Monitor:
- WebSocket connection to Streamlit server
- Any failed requests

### Elements Tab
Inspect:
- Checkbox input element exists in DOM
- Button elements with correct keys
- No conditional rendering hiding elements

## Expected Log Output

During processing with summarization enabled:
```
üìÅ User selected directory: C:/path/to/pdfs
üöÄ Starting batch processing of X PDF files
üîÑ Processing file 1/X: filename.pdf
üîç Starting OCR extraction for: filename.pdf
üìù Generating summary for: filename.pdf
‚úÖ Summary generated: 250 characters
üíæ Saving extracted text for: filename.pdf
‚úÖ Successfully processed: filename.pdf
```

## Issues to Watch For

1. **Checkbox not visible** - Check if it's accidentally inside a conditional block
2. **Button not appearing** - Verify SUMMARIZER_AVAILABLE flag and record has no summary
3. **Button click does nothing** - Check browser console for errors
4. **Page doesn't reload after summary** - st.rerun() might be failing
5. **Duplicate key warnings** - Multiple buttons/widgets with same key
6. **Layout broken** - CSS or Streamlit version issues

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All UI elements are visible without interaction
‚úÖ Checkbox appears and functions correctly
‚úÖ Generate Summary buttons appear for appropriate records
‚úÖ Clicking buttons triggers summarization
‚úÖ Page updates after summary generation
‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
‚úÖ Graceful error handling for API failures
