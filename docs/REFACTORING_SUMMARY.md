# Streamlit App Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The main Streamlit app file has been refactored to follow a clean separation of concerns pattern, similar to the PDF processor module. Business logic has been extracted into separate modules, leaving only UI rendering code in the Streamlit file.

## New Module Structure

### 1. `frontend/api_client.py`
**Purpose:** Backend API communication

**Functions:**
- `save_extracted_text_to_backend()` - Send processed PDF data to backend
- `get_records_from_backend()` - Fetch records from backend
- `get_stats_from_backend()` - Fetch statistics from backend
- `generate_summary_for_record()` - Request summary generation for a record
- `delete_record()` - Delete a record via backend API

**Responsibility:** All HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend

### 2. `frontend/file_operations.py`
**Purpose:** File system operations

**Functions:**
- `get_pdf_files_from_directory()` - Scan directory for PDF files
- `create_temp_file_from_upload()` - Save uploaded file to temporary location
- `cleanup_temp_file()` - Clean up temporary files

**Responsibility:** All file I/O operations including temp file management

### 3. `frontend/data_processing.py`
**Purpose:** PDF processing orchestration

**Functions:**
- `process_single_pdf()` - Process a single PDF file (hash, extract, send to backend)
- `process_pdf_batch()` - Process multiple PDFs from disk
- `process_uploaded_files()` - Process uploaded PDF files

**Responsibility:** Orchestrating the PDF processing workflow, combining file operations, text extraction, and API calls

### 4. `frontend/data_transforms.py`
**Purpose:** Data transformation and formatting

**Functions:**
- `shorten_hash()` - Shorten MD5 hash for display
- `filter_records()` - Filter records by filename and summary status
- `sort_records()` - Sort records by various criteria
- `format_timestamp()` - Format timestamp for display
- `prepare_dataframe_data()` - Transform records into DataFrame format

**Responsibility:** All data transformations and formatting for display

### 5. `frontend/state_manager.py`
**Purpose:** Streamlit session state management

**Functions:**
- `init_delete_confirmation_state()` - Initialize delete confirmation state
- `reset_delete_confirmation_on_selection_change()` - Reset state on record change
- `is_in_confirmation_mode()` - Check if in confirmation mode
- `set_confirmation_mode()` - Set confirmation mode
- `clear_delete_state()` - Clear all delete-related state

**Responsibility:** Managing session state for UI interactions (especially delete confirmation)

### 6. `frontend/streamlit_app.py` (Refactored)
**Purpose:** UI rendering only

**Functions:**
- `render_process_pdf_batch_ui()` - Render batch processing UI
- `render_process_uploaded_files_ui()` - Render upload processing UI
- `render_database_records()` - Render records table and filters
- `render_record_details()` - Render selected record details
- `render_generate_summary_button()` - Render summary generation button
- `render_delete_button()` - Render delete button with confirmation
- `main()` - Main app layout and tab structure

**Responsibility:** Only Streamlit component declarations and UI rendering

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is isolated from presentation logic
2. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently without Streamlit
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic don't affect UI code and vice versa
4. **Reusability**: Logic modules can be reused in other contexts (CLI tools, other frontends)
5. **Readability**: Each module has a clear, single responsibility
6. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as `shared/pdf_processor.py`

## Test Updates

The test file `tests/test_streamlit_functions.py` has been updated to:
- Test individual functions from each new module
- Mock dependencies appropriately
- Verify business logic without requiring Streamlit runtime
- Cover state management, data transformations, file operations, and API interactions

## Functionality Preserved

All existing functionality has been maintained:
- ✅ Folder processing
- ✅ File upload
- ✅ Record display with master-detail views
- ✅ Summary generation
- ✅ Delete operations with two-step confirmation
- ✅ Filtering and sorting
- ✅ Duplicate detection via MD5 hash
- ✅ Statistics display
- ✅ Error handling and progress tracking

## Code Quality

- All tests pass (58 passed)
- Linting clean (flake8)
- No syntax errors
- Proper error handling maintained
- Logging preserved throughout
