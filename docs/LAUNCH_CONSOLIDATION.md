# Launch Mechanism Consolidation

## Summary

Consolidated multiple launch scripts into a single entry point (`run.py`) and archived outdated scripts. The application now has a clear, consistent startup mechanism that launches both the FastAPI backend and the current Streamlit frontend with all summarization features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Unified Launch Script

**File**: `run.py`
- Single entry point for the entire application
- Starts both FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend simultaneously
- Better error handling and environment validation
- Clean console output with status indicators
- Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Environment verification before startup
- ✅ Real-time log streaming from both services
- ✅ Proper process management and cleanup
- ✅ Clear user feedback with emojis and formatting
- ✅ Runs the current `frontend/streamlit_app.py` with summarization features

### 2. Archived Deprecated Scripts

Moved to `deprecated/` directory:

1. **run_both.py** - Replaced by `run.py`
   - Similar functionality but less polished
   - Kept for reference

2. **start_backend.py** - Deprecated
   - Minimal FastAPI launcher
   - Use standard uvicorn command if needed

3. **start_fastapi.py** - Deprecated
   - Redundant with uvicorn command
   - More complex than necessary

4. **start_services.py** - Deprecated
   - Incomplete implementation
   - Only started FastAPI, not Streamlit

5. **streamlit_app.py** (root level) - **IMPORTANT: Outdated UI**
   - ⚠️ This is an OLD standalone version
   - Uses direct SQLite access instead of FastAPI backend
   - **Missing summarization features** from SUMMARY_FEATURE.md
   - Basic implementation without proper API integration
   - **Current version**: `frontend/streamlit_app.py` has all features

### 3. Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- Updated "Usage" section to feature `python run.py` as the primary command
- Clarified that this is the single entry point
- Moved individual service commands to "Advanced" section
- Added clear benefits of using the unified launcher

**New Files**:
- `deprecated/README.md` - Explains why each file was deprecated and provides migration guide
- `LAUNCH_CONSOLIDATION.md` (this file) - Documents the consolidation effort

**Updated Files**:
- `.gitignore` - Added `deprecated/` directory to ignore list

## Key Differences: Old vs Current Streamlit App

### Deprecated: `streamlit_app.py` (root)
```python
# OLD VERSION - DO NOT USE
- Direct SQLite database access
- No FastAPI backend integration
- Basic summarization with limited error handling
- Standalone architecture
- Missing API endpoints for summary generation
- Cannot leverage backend's summarization pipeline
```

### Current: `frontend/streamlit_app.py`
```python
# CURRENT VERSION - USE THIS
- Full FastAPI backend integration
- Uses REST API endpoints
- Complete summarization features from SUMMARY_FEATURE.md
- On-demand summary generation via UI
- Batch processing with summarization checkbox
- Proper error handling and status updates
- Consistent with backend architecture
```

## Migration Instructions

### For Users

**Old way** (deprecated):
```bash
python run_both.py
```

**New way** (current):
```bash
python run.py
```

### For Developers

If you need to run services individually:

**FastAPI only**:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**Streamlit only** (requires backend running):
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

## Features Available in Current Version

The current application (launched via `run.py`) includes:

### ✅ PDF Processing Features
- Batch PDF processing from directories
- OCR text extraction with Tesseract
- Text metrics (word count, character length)
- SQLite database storage

### ✅ Summarization Features (SUMMARY_FEATURE.md)
- Checkbox to enable summarization during batch processing
- On-demand summary generation for existing documents
- "Generate Summary" button in document records
- Automatic summary storage in database
- Chunking for large documents (>8k tokens)
- OpenAI-compatible API integration
- Graceful fallback when API key not configured

### ✅ API Endpoints
- `POST /process-pdf` - Process and store PDF with optional summary
- `GET /records` - Retrieve recent records with summaries
- `GET /records/no-summary` - Get records without summaries
- `PUT /records/{id}/summary` - Generate summary for specific record
- `GET /stats` - Database statistics

### ✅ UI Features
- Directory browser for PDF selection
- Real-time progress tracking
- Expandable document cards with summaries
- Database statistics dashboard
- Error handling and user feedback

## Testing

The consolidation was verified by:
1. ✅ Checking that `run.py` starts both services correctly
2. ✅ Verifying `frontend/streamlit_app.py` has summarization features
3. ✅ Confirming `deprecated/streamlit_app.py` is the old standalone version
4. ✅ Updating all documentation to reflect the changes
5. ✅ Adding `deprecated/` to `.gitignore`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Use `python run.py` to start the application
2. ✅ Verify you're accessing http://localhost:8501 (frontend with features)
3. ✅ Test summarization features with a sample PDF

### Future Cleanup
- Consider removing deprecated files after a transition period
- Update any CI/CD pipelines to use `python run.py`
- Archive old scripts to version control history

## Conclusion

The application launch mechanism is now consolidated into a single, clear entry point that:
- ✅ Starts the correct version of the frontend (with summarization)
- ✅ Properly integrates with the FastAPI backend
- ✅ Provides a better user experience
- ✅ Eliminates confusion from multiple launch scripts
- ✅ Makes the architecture clear and maintainable

**Command to remember**: `python run.py`
