# Desktop Application Setup - Summary

## What Was Implemented

The Streamlit PDF OCR application has been configured to be built as a standalone Windows executable (.exe) following the PyInstaller approach for desktop applications.

## Files Created

### 1. `desktop_app.py` - Desktop Launcher
A standalone launcher that:
- Starts FastAPI backend on port 8000 in a background thread
- Launches Streamlit frontend on port 8501
- Automatically opens the browser to http://127.0.0.1:8501
- Checks if ports are already in use to avoid conflicts
- Handles both services gracefully

### 2. `build_exe.py` - Build Script
PyInstaller build script that:
- Creates a single executable file (`--onefile`)
- Runs without console window (`--windowed`)
- Bundles all Python dependencies (Streamlit, FastAPI, etc.)
- Includes hidden imports for all required packages
- Packages the frontend and app directories
- Outputs to `dist/PDFOCRApp.exe`

### 3. `BUILD_EXE.md` - Comprehensive Documentation
Complete guide covering:
- Prerequisites and system requirements
- Build instructions (automated and manual)
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Deployment guidelines
- Customization options
- Performance considerations

### 4. `README_DESKTOP_BUILD.md` - Quick Start Guide
Quick reference for:
- Build steps
- Testing the executable
- Important notes about external dependencies
- Debugging tips

## Files Updated

### `requirements.txt`
Added:
- `streamlit` - Frontend framework
- `pyinstaller` - EXE build tool

### `.gitignore`
Added:
- `*.spec` - PyInstaller specification files

## How to Build

```bash
# 1. Ensure dependencies are installed
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the build script
python build_exe.py

# 3. Test the executable
.\dist\PDFOCRApp.exe
```

## Build Output

After running the build:
- `dist/PDFOCRApp.exe` - The standalone executable (~100+ MB)
- `build/` - Temporary build files (can be deleted)
- `PDFOCRApp.spec` - PyInstaller spec (gitignored, can customize if needed)

## How It Works

1. **Launch Process**:
   - User runs `PDFOCRApp.exe`
   - FastAPI backend starts on http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Streamlit frontend launches on http://127.0.0.1:8501
   - Default browser opens automatically

2. **Bundling**:
   - PyInstaller bundles Python interpreter, all libraries, and app code
   - Single file extraction to temp directory on first run
   - All frontend and backend code included

3. **Services**:
   - Both FastAPI and Streamlit run from the bundled Python
   - Communication happens via localhost HTTP
   - No external Python installation needed on target system

## Important Requirements

### Included in EXE:
✅ Python interpreter  
✅ All Python packages (FastAPI, Streamlit, PIL, NumPy, etc.)  
✅ Application code (frontend, app directories)  
✅ Streamlit configuration  

### NOT Included (Must Install Separately):
❌ **Tesseract OCR** - Required for OCR functionality
   - Download: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Install to: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`

❌ **Poppler** - Required for PDF to image conversion
   - Must be in system PATH or app directory

❌ **OpenAI API Key** - If using AI summarization
   - Configure via `.env` file

## Deployment Checklist

When distributing the application:

- [ ] Copy `dist/PDFOCRApp.exe` to target system
- [ ] Provide Tesseract OCR installation instructions
- [ ] Include `.env.example` for configuration
- [ ] Document Poppler setup if needed
- [ ] Test on clean Windows system
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting documentation

## Performance Notes

- **First Launch**: Slow (extracting bundled files to temp)
- **Subsequent Launches**: Faster (files already extracted)
- **File Size**: Large (~100+ MB due to Python + all libraries)
- **Memory**: Both services run in same process space
- **Startup Time**: ~5-10 seconds typical

## Alternative Build Options

### One Directory Mode
For faster startup at the cost of multiple files:
```python
# In build_exe.py, change:
'--onefile',  # Remove this
# to:
'--onedir',   # Use this instead
```

### With Console Window (for debugging)
```python
# In build_exe.py, comment out:
# '--windowed',
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build process**:
   ```bash
   python build_exe.py
   ```

2. **Test the executable**:
   ```bash
   .\dist\PDFOCRApp.exe
   ```

3. **Optional: Add an icon**:
   - Get a `.ico` file
   - Update `build_exe.py`: `'--icon=path/to/icon.ico'`
   - Rebuild

4. **Optional: Create installer**:
   - Use Inno Setup or NSIS
   - Bundle Tesseract and Poppler
   - Create desktop shortcuts
   - Add to Start Menu

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with import errors
- Add missing imports to `--hidden-import` in `build_exe.py`
- Use `--collect-all=package_name` for packages needing all files

### EXE doesn't start
- Remove `--windowed` from `build_exe.py` to see errors
- Run from command line to see console output

### "Tesseract not found" error
- Install Tesseract OCR
- Set `TESSERACT_PATH` environment variable

### Large file size
- Normal for bundled Python applications
- Consider `--onedir` for distribution
